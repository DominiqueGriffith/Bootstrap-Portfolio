                    <h6><p align ="justify">Greetings, my name is Dom! I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I went
                        to
                        college at American University in Washington, DC, where I studied International Affairs for 4
                        years.
                        Always having a love for learning new languages and cultures, I studied abroad for a year in Rio
                        de
                        Janeiro, Brazil between 2010 and 2011.</p>

                        <p align ="justify">Upon returning from Rio, I graduated college and moved to New York City. In New York I worked
                            as a
                            Creative Project Manager, aiding teams of graphic designers, developers, and marketers in
                            creating 
                            successful marketing campaigns.</p>

                        <p align ="justify">In 2018 I decided to take break from New York's fast-pace lifestyle, and I embarked on a
                            journey to
                            teach English at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz in the small city of Ilh√©us,
                            Brazil. My return
                            to Brazil enabled me to enhance my Portuguese skills and further explore my interest in
                            Latin American
                            history and literature.</p>

                        <p align ="justify">I finally returned to the States in 2019 and I'm now looking to rejoin the corporate world as
                            a Web
                            Developer.</p>

                        <p align ="justify">When I'm not working or traveling you can catch me reading a book or watching a movie about a
                            remote
                            area of the world. You'll also find me lost at thought drawling or playing videogames
                            (Resident Evil 2
                            Remake was so good!).
